I've been having nice success with continue.dev + ollama + Open Web UI.

# Getting Started

1. `docker compose up -d`
1. Run pull.sh to grab the models I am liking.
1. Install the continue.dev extension in VS Code.
1. Use config.json for continue.dev (drop it into
   ~/.continue/config.json).

# Observations

I'm still getting used to all of this, but it's really nice being able
to provide your code as context to the models without worrying about
confidential data.
